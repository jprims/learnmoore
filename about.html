    <p>Self-Aggrandizing Autobiographical Sketch:</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was born in 1970 to two outstanding parents, Lillian and Richard Moore, in Minnesota. I went to Second Foundation, a free school in Minneapolis. During 1980, my family lived in Berlin, Germany for 6 months and I attended the John F. Kennedy School. In 1982 we moved from St. Paul to Johannesburg, South Africa. We lived there for 5 years and I attended the American International School of Johannesburg. In 1987 we moved to Pocatello, Idaho where I completed the last two years of high school.</p>
    <br>
	   <p>I graduated from high school in 1989 and went to Carleton College. I majored in Psychology and got a concentration in Natural History. Upon graduation, I went to work for McMaster-Carr Supply Company in Elmhurst, Illinois, doing dreadfully dull work for which I was generously compensated. In July 1995 I left McMaster-Carr to work as a research assistant to Max Bazerman in the Organization Behavior Department at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. There I did fascinating work for which I was paid a pittance.  It was much better.  In the Fall of 1996 I started in the Ph.D. program in Organization Behavior at Kellogg.  </p>
	   <br>
	   <p>I married the stunningly beautiful and highly talented Sarah Miller in June of 1999.  In August of 2000, I began as an Assistant Professor in the Organzational Behavior group at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University.  In 2002, my first son Josh was born.  I visited the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales in Sydney for the first three months of 2003 and again for the first three months of 2007. I visited in the Social Psychology Department (Psychologie II) at the University of Wurzburg, Germany, for the summer of 2004. In 2005, my second son Anderson was born.  I got tenure at CMU in 2008.  In the 2008-2009 academic year I was a visitor at the Haas School at the University of California at Berkeley.  Then, because my family really likes schlepping back and forth across the country, we went back to Pittsburgh for a year.  In August of 2010 we returned on a more permanent basis to California where I accepted a job in the Management of Organizations group (MOoRe'S) at the Haas School.</p>
