        <p>Hello, my name is Claire! I am a second year majoring in psychology. I’m an international student from South Korea, but I have studied in Oregon for nine years. I’m really interested in the way that people interact with each other in group settings and how various internal factors, like positivity, create results in the external world (and vice versa). Currently, my plan after college is to go on to graduate school to pursue either organizational psychology or clinical psychology, or both. I love traveling, taking pictures, and spending time with my family.

        <p>I am a senior attending the University of California, Berkeley. I am a psychology major and I intend to pursue a master's program or medical school with hopes of being a therapist and or a psychiatrist one day. My family's background as refugees and their struggle as stateless people has inspired my interest in the big question of “why?” This interest in this question has led me to the studying of human behavior, language, cognition, and their social relationships. On top of being a research assistant, I have also been a student activist throughout college on several campuses and in the community, to raise awareness about stigma, prejudice, human rights and animal rights. She has volunteered with several organizations and clubs including Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), A.N.S.W.E.R. L.A., and Global Resistance Network (GRN).

        <p>I'm a second year Psychology major on exchange from New Zealand. I hope to gain valuable research experience for Graduate school, where I plan on studying Psychology. I am currently planning to study Clinical Psychology but I do not know for sure. I am hoping this research experience will guide my interests and help me discover what I actually want to study. I'm interested in the effects of societal level problems on the psychological well being of individuals, and also in Social Psychology. I lived in Venezuela for a year on an exchange, so I can speak fluent Spanish, and I love to travel. I also enjoy reading, listening to music, and watching movies. I love animals and have volunteered at the SPCA in Auckland, New Zealand, since I was 15. I also volunteer in Auckland with a youth counselling service called Youthline.
