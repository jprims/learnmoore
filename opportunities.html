<p>&emsp; We are always eager to collaborate with motivated undergraduate students who take an interest in research. The Undergraduate Research Associate Program here at Berkeley offers a great opportunity for undergraduates to gain research experience. <br>
&emsp;We are seeking research apprentices who can commit 9-12 hours a week for at least two semesters. </p>

<br><br>
<p><i>&emsp; "The experiences and skills I gained as an undergrad research associate in Professor Moore's lab have been invaluable to me as a student, professional, and life long learner. The RA experience within the Moore Lab provided me with the opportunity to develop my quantitative skills through the cleaning and analysis of experimental data, my qualitative skills through diverse research and writing tasks, and my scientific instinct through the implementation of studies and the chance to participate in discussions on theory and experimental design. Even beyond the skill development, what makes Professor Moore's lab unique is that the lab as a whole is invested in providing you with a well rounded research experience and the opportunity to stretch your mind and explore your interests within the social sciences. " <b> - Jonathan Wang</b></i></p>

<br>

<p><i>&emsp; "This lab provides the perfect opportunity to get exposure to research. During the year and a half I spent working in this lab, I earned research experience that not only helped me get into a PhD program directly after graduating from Berkeley, but also gave me the preparation I needed to understand the whole research process: from idea generation to data analysis. Professor Moore and Jenn Logg always encourage creativity and feedback on research projects and are open to exploring new ideas. When I decided to apply to PhD programs, Professor Moore and Jenn Logg worked with me to improve my skill set and supported me with in depth meetings about the field and valuable insights about the application process. I am forever thankful for all they did for me during my time working in the lab. If you have any interest in pursuing experimental research as a career, this lab will give you the foundation you need." <b>- Shalena Srna, PhD Student at the University of Pennsylvania</b> </i></p>

<p>
<br>
____ will be working with Professor Don Moore, and doctoral student Jennifer Logg on projects surrounding forecasting, confidence, overconfidence, and leadership. There will be a range of responsibilities, including:<br>
<p>1) attend regular meetings and to contribute ideas to the design and execution of the project.</p>
<p>2) help to run experiments, which will involve preparing materials, keeping track of and organizing data files, reserving lab spaces, and managing participants.</p>
<p>3) help in the entry and analysis of the data collected from these experiments or from the classroom.</p>
<p>4) present the results of these experiments to our lab group.</p>
<p>5) help with related work such as obtaining copies of scholarly articles or preparing materials for the experimental research. This work may also include reviewing a research area and providing a summary or critique of the topic.</p>
<p>6) review and critique scholarly writing.</p>
<br>
Approximate time commitments <br>
Meetings: 2.5 hr/week for 14 weeks = 35 hours<br>
Running experiments: 8 hrs/week for 14 weeks = 112 hours<br>
Homework, reading, and other activities: 2 hrs/week for 14 weeks = 28 hours<br>
Other research-related support activities: 175 hours total
<br><br>
So, overall, this apprenticeship entails a commitment of 175 hours, or 10-11 hours a week for the semester. We expect that it will be an excellent learning and hands-on research experience. As far as our evaluation of performance, putting in the hours and remaining a committed member of our team will lead to a passing grade.
